                    <p>
                        I am a former art major turned engineering major turned computer science major graduating with a B.S. from UC Irvine
                        in Spring of 2020! I love animation so I wanted to become an animator, but I am a huge nerd and I love physics and math
                        so I switched to mechanical engineering. But then, I found computer science and I fell in love with it. CS allows
                        me to go into almost any field, especially animation.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to eventually work in the animation field, combining my love for art, storytelling and computer science. 
                        In the meantime, I just want to work somewhere where I can make a difference.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I like to play basketball, go to Disneyland, watch movies, draw, play with my cats and take care of my 
                        plants. I currently have five cats and ten houseplants but I always want more. 
                        I love visiting national parks and I hope to visit all of them one day.
